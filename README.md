# Beamer theme for Food and Resource Economics Department, University of Florida

Although I use the official colors, and one of the official background pictures, I created this theme for my personal use, therefore is NOT OFFICIAL. Please, use this template freely and let me know any improvement.

It is possible to find this template at [Overleaf](https://es.overleaf.com/latex/templates/fred-uf-beamer-theme/rryfbqfnvnjs) as well.

## NOTE
You can change the background opacity in the file: `UFtheme.sty`, line `22`. Is 25% by default, but you can reduce this number if you want to make more white the background, or increase it if you want the picture sharper.
